This repository provides a python implementation of an exploratory approach to correct detected biomarker positions such as fiducial points in the ECG (P, Q, R, S, T waves). This is achieved by utilizing a Kalman filter to predict the feature's position while, on the other hand, the detections/measurements are used to update the Kalman filter.
